## 🚀 Quick Start

**Build:**
```sh
go build -o gotune cmd/tuner
```

**Run:**

## 🧪 Running Tests

### Go tests
Run all Go tests:
```sh
go test ./...
```

### Python reference tests
The Python implementation in `python/` is the reference for pitch detection accuracy.

To run Python tests:
```sh
cd python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python test_mpm.py
```

## 📖 Reference Implementation


The `python/` directory contains a pure Python implementation of the McLeod Pitch Method (MPM), used as a reference for validating the Go port. Use it to compare results, function signatures, and accuracy.
